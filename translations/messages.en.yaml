  about:
    title: "About Us"
    body: "Today, Shop App standards of quality are just as uncompromising as when the brand was founded.
              Every piece is created by artisans who have dedicated their lives to learning the art of making
              beautiful and practical leather goods. Through unparalleled craftsmanship, Shop App is made to
              last.

              Over the years, we’ve built long-standing relationships with our production partners, each one
              rooted in trust and a commitment to excellence. In fact, the Shop App original collection is still
              crafted in the same factory in Norwalk, CT that produced the very first commercially available
              Shop App product — the Express No. 2.

              These artisans created many of the pieces that serve as the building blocks of our heritage,
              from the handcrafted goods made for President Ronald Reagan to the countless Examiner No. 5
              briefcases carried by the who’s-who of Wall Street in the late 80’s and early 90’s."
